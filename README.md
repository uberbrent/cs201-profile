Website reflection - 

This was a fantastic reintroduction to building websites. I spent the better part of 3 years learning through a coding bootcamp
and working full time at a small code house in Green Bay. The time I spent in the online web space really honed my passion for 
writing code and building applications and websites. I got very deep into building React, Angular, and PHP applications and many more
advanced techniques. 

This class was great for getting back to the basics of JavaScript and reminding me of the building blocks of these applications, it
brought back the joy of working on the code and not just pulling in libraries where they were needed. Something about coding that has
always attrated me is the problem solving aspect and the complete adherance to logic. When there is a problem before you, it's
imperative that you walk through the logic step by step.

My plan now that I'm done with this project and have regained my passion for working on the code is to work on some personal projects
to fill out my portfolio and rebuild the portfolio website that I build for this class using a single page application like React and 
really fall in love with the process of building an application. I'm also going to spend some time on the infrastructure side of
web sites and applications, when I worked at the coding company I had a guy who would deploy the applications to live websites.

Initial steps are going to be to rebuild this website and then learn the steps to deploy that website on my own. From there use the knowledge
gained in this class and from previous experience to build new applications that would help my portfolio shine.
